# Data-Cleaning-In-SQL
This repository contains SQL scripts for cleaning and preparing the Nashville Housing dataset for analysis. 
The scripts use SQL queries to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis. 
The project structure follows a modular approach, with separate scripts for each step of the data cleaning process. Contributions are welcome via pull requests.
